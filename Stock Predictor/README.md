# Apple Stock Predictor

## Project Overview

The Apple Stock Predictor is an self learnt machine learning project aimed at forecasting the future prices of Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock. Utilizing TensorFlow, this project pulls historical stock data to create an accurate predictive model. The primary goal is to assist investors and traders in making informed decisions by providing reliable stock price predictions and displaying them using graphs.

## Technical Stack

* TensorFlow: The core machine learning framework for building and training the predictive model using LSTM.
* Python: Primary programming language for data manipulation, model development, and integration.
* Pandas & NumPy: Libraries for efficient data handling and numerical computations.
* Matplotlib : Visualization libraries to plot stock price trends and prediction results.

## Workflow

1. Data Collection: Gather historical stock data using Yahoo Finance as yfinance.
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to ensure it is suitable for model training.
3. Model Development: Design and implement neural network models using TensorFlow.
4. Training and Validation: Train the models on historical data and validate their performance.
5. Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model parameters to enhance prediction accuracy.
6. Prediction and Visualization: Generate stock price predictions and visualize the results.

## Expected Outcomes

* Accurate Stock Predictions: A highly accurate model capable with a loss of 0.0001 to predict future Apple stock prices.
* Enhanced Decision-Making: Improved decision-making for investors and traders based on reliable predictions.

## Future Enhancements

* Expand to Other Stocks: Extend the model to predict prices of other stocks and financial instruments.
* Advanced Visualization Tools: Develop more sophisticated visualization tools for better user insights.
